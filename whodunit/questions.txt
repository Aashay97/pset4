1.  stdint.h is a C library header file which defines certain integer datatypes with specified widths and has some macros.
2.  These data types are of fixed length hence they are independent of the platform used to access.
3.  BYTE-8 bits  ;  DWORD-32 bits  ;  LONG-32 bits  ;  WORD-16 bits  ;
4.  BM for bitmap
5.  bfSize specifies the size of the entire .bmp image.
    biSize specifies the size of the structure BITMAPINFOHEADER.
6.  A negative biHeight implies that the pixel information is stored in a top to bottom approach
    starting from the top left and ending with the bottom right corners.
7.  biBitCount specifies the color depth.
8.  NULL might be returned if the file specified does not exist or if the user doesn't have permission to access the file.
9.  The 3rd argument specifies the number of blocks to be read at a time. We are reading only 1 struct at a time.
10. 3 bytes
11. fseek moves to a specific location in the file.
12. SEEK_CUR is an argument for fseek.
    It is used to seek from the current location.
